We can rephrase the LOB game as a reinforcement learning problem. The states of the MDP contain information on the inventory $s^I_t \in \{ 0, \dots, T \}$, the cash $s^C_t \in \mathbb{R}$ and the price $s^P_t \in \mathbb{R}$. For every action $Q_t \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ from any state $s_t = (s^I_t, s^C_t, s^P_t)$ we can compute the reward at time $t$ as $r_t(s_{t-1}, Q_t) = \delta_t(Q_t) s^I_{t-1}$ and the next state using the transition function $\Delta_t(s_{t-1}, Q_t) = (s^I_t + Q_t, s^C_t - Q_t(s^P_t + \delta_t(Q_t)), s^P_t + \delta_t(Q_t))$, where both change with time to reflect the change in density and therefore $\delta_t(\cdot)$.

The resulting MDP is structured as a tree, where each node has at most 3 children and we want to find a path from the root to a leaf with the highest cumulative reward.
